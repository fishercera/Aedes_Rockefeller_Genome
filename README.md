# Aedes_Rockefeller_Genome
Archive of assembly and annotation scripts, and collection of genome files, for the *Aedes aegypti* Rockefeller genome. 

## Use of data

Draft assemblies, annotation files, and bioninformatic scripts are made available here in the spirit of open biological data practices. These are pre-publication data and should not be relied upon as the final genome product until after peer review. Just prior to publication, I will make a 1.0 release and add a DOI. Before then, please contact cfisher@cornell.edu before using these data in your projects.
